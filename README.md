	<summary><strong>project prefrences</strong></summary>
	<p>
	when working with web-based projects it depends on what it is, if it's a program that turns data into another form of data or visualises that data there is a very high chance i won't be using a langauge like php. below this is my current prefrences (frameworks/langauges) for what type of application i want to make. currently, i perfer the GNU LGPLv3 license compared to the license i was using for nearly all of my projects (GPL2.0/3.0). You can compare those changes by googling those licenses.

  - **node.js**
  	- webpack
  	- jQuery
