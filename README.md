	<summary>project prefrences</summary>
	
	when working with web-based projects it depends on what it is, if it's a program that turns data into another form of data or visualises that data there is a very high chance i won't be using a langauge like php. below this is my current prefrences (frameworks/langauges) for what type of application i want to make. currently, i perfer the GNU LGPLv3 license compared to the license i was using for nearly all of my projects (GPL2.0/3.0). You can compare those changes by googling those licenses.

- dynamic web projects (no client-side authentication)
  - **node.js**
  - webpack
  - jQuery
- dynamic web projects (with client-side authentication)
  - **php** (serving pages that require authentication)
  - webpack (client-side processing)
- desktop applications (heavy reliance on API's)
  - **node.js**
  - electron
  - jquery
  - axios
  - custom API wrapper
- desktop applications (performance > looks)
  - **C#**
  - .NET framework (or mono)
- cli applications
  - **node.js**
  - signale
  - custom API wrapper (if required)
- internal tools (remote management, etc...)
  - java (client)
  - node.js (server)
  - php (depends)
